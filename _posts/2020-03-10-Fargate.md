## Features
![fargate](https://dasoldasol.github.io/assets/images/image/fargate.png)
- AWS Fargate : a **serverless compute engine for containers** that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
- Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your application :
  - removes the need to provision and manage servers
  - lets you specify and pay for resources per application
  - improves security through application isolation by design.
- Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity.    
You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is **no over-provisioning** and paying for additional servers.
- Fargate runs each task or pod in its own kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment.     
This enables your application to have workload isolation and improved security by design.     
This is why customers such as Vanguard, Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have chosen to run their mission critical applications on Fargate.

## Scenario
- A new **online banking** platform has been re-designed to have a **microservices architecture** in which complex applications are decomposed into smaller, independent services. The new platform is using **Docker** considering that application containers are optimal for running small, decoupled services. The new solution **should remove the need to provision and manage servers**, let you specify and **pay for resources per application**, and **improve security through application isolation by design**.    
Which of the following is the MOST suitable service to use to migrate this new platform to AWS?
  - **A) AWS Fargate**
