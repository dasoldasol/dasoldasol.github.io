## SQS
### Features
![sqs-concept](./image/sqs.png)
- A Web Service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them
- A Queue is a **temporary repository** for messages that are awaiting processing
- Using SQS, you can **decouple the components** of an application so they run independently.
- SQS is **Pull-basexd**
- Messages are 256KB in size
- Messages can be kept in the queue from 1min to 14 days; the default retention period is 4 days
- SQS guarantees that your messages will be processed **at least once**
- **SQS long polling**
  - A way to retrieve messages from SQS queues
  - While the regular **short polling** returns immediately, long polling doesn't return a response until a message arrives in the message queue, or the long poll times out.

### 2 Queue Types 
- Standard Queues(default) 
- FIFO Queues : exactly-once processing

### Visibility Time Out
- The amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS queue after a reader picks up that message.
- Provided the job is processed before the visibility time out expires, the message will then be deleted from the queue
- If the job is not processed within that time, the message will become visible again and another reader will process. This could result in the same message being **delievered twice**
- Visibility timeout max is 12 hours


## SWF
### Features
- Simple Workflow Service 
- **Tasks** represent invocations of various processing steps in an application which can be performed by execurable code, web service calls, human actions, and scripts. 
- **SWF Actors** : Workflow Starters, Deciders, Activity Workers
### SWF vs. SQS
|Feature|SWF|SQS|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|retention period|1 year|14 days|
|API|Task-oriented API|Message-oriented API|
|duplicated|a task is assigned only once. NEVER duplicated|you need to handle duplicated messages|
|tracking|keeps track of all the tasks and events|you need to implement your own application-level tracking

## SNS
### Features 
- Simple Notification Service
- Makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud. 
- **SQS Integration** : SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS or email to SQS queues / HTTP endpoint
- Instantaneous, **push-based** delivery (no polling)
- Simple APIs and easy integration with applications 
- Flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
- Inexpensive, pay-as-you-go model with no up-front costs 
- Web-based AWS Management Console offers the simplicity
- **SNS vs. SQS**
  - Both Messaging Service
  - SNS - Push
  - SQS - Polls(Pulls)

## Elastic Transcoder
- Media transcoder in the cloud.

## API Gateway 
- API Gateway Options
- API Gateway Configuration
- API Gateway Deployment
- API Gateway Caching : increase performance 
- **Same Origin Policy** : A web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page. This is done to prevent **Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)** attacks. 
- **CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** : allows restricted resources to be requested from another domain
  - If you are using Javascript/AZAX that uses multiple domains with API Gateway, you have to enable CORS on API Gateway

## Kinesis
- Streaming Data : Purchases from online stores, Stock Prices, Game data, Social network data, Geospatial data(uber), IoT sensor data
### 3 Types of Kinesis
- Kinesis Streams 
  - Shards : the total capacity of the stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards.

- Kinesis Firehose

- Kinesis Analytics

## Cognito - Web Identity Federation
- **Web Identity Federation**
  - Give your users access to AWS resources after they have authenticated with a Web ID Provider(Amazon, Facebook, Google..)
  - Following successful authentication, the user receives an **authentication code** from web id provider, which they can trade for **temporary AWS security credentials**.
- Use Cases
![cognito-process](./image/cognito-1.png)
- Cognito User Pools vs. Identity Pools(actual granting)
  - **User Pool** : A **User Directory** used to sign-in directly to the User Pool. Cognito acts as an Identity Broker between the id provider and AWS. Successful authentication generates a JSON Web Token(JWTs)
  - **Identity Pool** : enable **provide temporary AWS credentials**
- Cognito Synchronisation : Various different devices

## Scenario
- You have a web application hosted in EC2 that consumes messages from an **SQS** queue and is integrated with SNS to send out an email to you once the process is complete. You received 5 orders but after a few hours, you saw 20 email notifications in your inbox.    
Which of the following could be the possible culprit for this issue?
  - **A) The web application is not deleting the messages in the SQS queue after it has processed them.**
  - Always remember that the messages in the SQS queue will continue to exist even after the EC2 instance has processed it, until you delete that message. You have to ensure that you delete the message after processing to prevent the message from being received and processed again once the visibility timeout expires.

- A multi-tiered application hosted in your on-premises data center is scheduled to be migrated to AWS. The application has a **message broker service** which uses **industry standard messaging APIs** and protocols that must be migrated as well, without rewriting the messaging code in your application.    
Which of the following is the most suitable service that you should use to move your messaging service to AWS?
  - **A) Amazon MQ**
  - Amazon MQ, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS are messaging services that are suitable for anyone from startups to enterprises. If you're using messaging with existing applications and want to move your messaging service to the cloud quickly and easily, it is recommended that you consider Amazon MQ. It supports industry-standard APIs and protocols so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code in your application
  - Amazon SWF : is incorrect because this is a fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator service and not a messaging service

- A traffic monitoring and reporting application uses Kinesis to accept real-time data. In order to process and store the data, they used Amazon **Kinesis Data Firehose** to load the streaming data to various AWS resources.       
Which of the following services can you **load streaming data into**?
  - **A) Amazon Elasticsearch Service**
  - **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** : capture, transform, and load streaming data into **Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk**, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards youâ€™re already using today.
  - **S3 Select** : is incorrect because S3 Select is just a feature of Amazon S3 that makes it easy to retrieve specific data from the contents of an object using simple SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object.
  - **Redshift Spectrum** : is incorrect because Redshift Spectrum is also just a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3 with no loading or ETL required.
