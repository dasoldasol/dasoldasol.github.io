## Scenario
- A traffic monitoring and reporting application uses Kinesis to accept real-time data. In order to process and store the data, they used Amazon **Kinesis Data Firehose** to load the streaming data to various AWS resources.       
Which of the following services can you **load streaming data into**?
  - **A) Amazon Elasticsearch Service**
  - **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** : capture, transform, and load streaming data into **Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk**, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today.
  - **S3 Select** : is incorrect because S3 Select is just a feature of Amazon S3 that makes it easy to retrieve specific data from the contents of an object using simple SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object.
  - **Redshift Spectrum** : is incorrect because Redshift Spectrum is also just a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3 with no loading or ETL required.
  
- A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and **API Gateway**. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant **increase in site visitors** and new users in the coming days ahead.    
In this scenario, how can you **protect the backend systems** of the platform from traffic spikes?
  - **A) enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway**
  - **throttling** : Amazon API Gateway provides throttling at multiple levels including global and by service call. Throttling limits can be set for standard rates and bursts. For example, API owners can set a rate limit of 1,000 requests per second for a specific method in their REST APIs, and also configure Amazon API Gateway to handle a burst of 2,000 requests per second for a few seconds. Amazon API Gateway tracks the number of requests per second. Any request over the limit will receive a 429 HTTP response. The client SDKs generated by Amazon API Gateway retry calls automatically when met with this response.
  - **caching** : The cache is provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs. This improves performance and reduces the traffic sent to your back end. Cache settings allow you to control the way the cache key is built and the time-to-live (TTL) of the data stored for each method. Amazon API Gateway also exposes management APIs that help you invalidate the cache for each stage.

  - **CloudFront** : is incorrect because CloudFront only speeds up content delivery which provides a better latency experience for your users. It does not help much for the backend.

- You are using a combination of **API Gateway** and Lambda for the web services of your online web portal that is being accessed by hundreds of thousands of clients each day. Your company will be announcing a new revolutionary product and it is expected that your web portal will receive a massive number of visitors all around the globe. How can you **protect your backend systems and applications from traffic spikes**?
  - **A) Use throttling limits in API Gateway**

- You have a data analytics application that updates a real-time, foreign exchange dashboard and another separate application that archives data to Amazon Redshift. Both applications are configured to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently by using **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.**      
However, you noticed that there are a lot of occurrences where a **shard iterator expires unexpectedly**. Upon checking, you found out that the DynamoDB table used by Kinesis does not have enough **capacity to store** the lease data.    
Which of the following is the most suitable solution to rectify this issue?
  - **A) Increase the write capacity assigned to the shard table.**
  - **Enabling In-Memory Acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** : is incorrect because the DAX feature is primarily used for **read performance** improvement of your DynamoDB table from milliseconds response time to microseconds.

- You are working as a Cloud Consultant for a government agency with a mandate of improving traffic planning, maintenance of roadways and preventing accidents. There is a need to manage traffic infrastructure in real time, alert traffic engineers and emergency response teams when problems are detected, and automatically change traffic signals to get emergency personnel to accident scenes faster by **using sensors and smart devices**.

- You are working for a **Social Media Analytics** company as its head data analyst. You want to **collect gigabytes of data per second** from websites and social media feeds to gain insights from data generated by its offerings and continuously improve the user experience. To meet this design requirement, you have developed an application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of Spot EC2 instances which processes the data and stores the results to DynamoDB and Redshift.     
Which AWS service can you use to **collect and process large streams of data records in real time**? 
  - **A) Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**
  - IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real time, the processing is typically lightweight.
  - **S3** : is incorrect because this is mainly used for object storage of frequently and infrequently accessed files with high durability.
  - **Redshift** : is incorrect because this is mainly used for data warehousing making it simple and cost-effective to analyze your data across your data warehouse and data lake.

- You installed sensors to track the number of visitors that goes to the park. The data is sent everyday to an **Amazon Kinesis stream** with default settings for processing, in which a consumer is configured to process the data every other day. You noticed that your S3 bucket is **not receiving all of the data that is being sent to the Kinesis stream**. You checked the sensors if they are properly sending the data to Amazon Kinesis and verified that the data is indeed sent everyday.    
What could be the reason for this?
  - **A) By default, the data records are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a Kinesis stream**
  - **retention period** : A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default to a maximum of 168 hours.

- You are working for a data analytics company as a Software Engineer, which has a client that is setting up an innovative checkout-free grocery store. You developed a monitoring application that uses smart sensors to collect the items that your customers are getting from the grocery’s refrigerators and shelves then automatically maps it to their accounts. To know more about the buying behavior of your customers, you want to analyze the items that are constantly being bought and store the results in S3 for durable storage.       
What **service can you use to easily capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk**? 
  - **A) Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**
  - **Amazon Kinesis** : is incorrect because this is the streaming data platform of AWS and has four distinct services under it: Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. 
  - **Amazon Macie** : is incorrect because this is mainly utilized as a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.

- An application is using a RESTful API hosted in AWS which uses **Amazon API Gateway** and AWS Lambda. There is a requirement to **trace and analyze user requests as they travel through your Amazon API Gateway APIs** to the underlying services.     
Which of the following is the most suitable service to use to meet this requirement?
  - **A) AWS X-Ray**
  - X-Ray gives you an end-to-end view of an entire request, so you can analyze latencies in your APIs and their backend services. 
  - debug and analyze your microservices applications with request tracing so you can find the root cause of your issues and performance.
    ![apigateway-xray-traceview-1](./image/apigateway-xray-traceview-1.png)

  - **SWF** : is incorrect because this is a fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator service. It does not provide serverless orchestration to multiple AWS resources.

- A data analytics application requires a service that can collect, process, and **analyze clickstream data** from various websites in **real-time**. Which of the following is the most suitable service to use for the application?
  - **A) Kinesis**
  - **Redshift Spectrum** :  is incorrect because this is primarily used to directly query open data formats stored in Amazon S3. it enables you to analyze data across your data warehouse and data lake, together, with a single service. It does not provide the ability to process your data in real-time.
  - **AWS Glue** : is incorrect because this is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. It does not provide the ability to process your data in real-time.
  - **Amazon EMR with Compute Optimized Instances** : is incorrect because this is a web service that uses an open-source Hadoop framework to quickly & cost-effectively process vast amounts of data. It does not provide the ability to process your data in real-time. Compute-optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors but not for analyzing clickstream data from various websites in real-time.

- You are working as a Solutions Architect for a startup in which you are tasked to develop a custom messaging service that will also be used to train their AI for an automatic response feature which they plan to implement in the future. Based on their research and tests, the service can receive up to thousands of messages a day, and all of these data are to be sent to Amazon EMR for further processing. It is crucial that **none of the messages will be lost, no duplicates will be produced** and that they are processed in EMR in the same order as their arrival.    
Which of the following options should you implement to meet the startup's requirements?
  - **A) Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream to collect the messages.**
  - **A Kinesis data stream** is a set of **shards** that has a sequence of data records, and each data record has a sequence number that is assigned by Kinesis Data Streams.    
  **Kinesis** can also easily handle the high volume of messages being sent to the service.
  - **SQS** : is incorrect. A default queue in SQS is just a standard queue and not a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. In addition, SQS does **not guarantee that no duplicates will be sent**.
  - **SNS** : is incorrect. SNS mig. ht not be capable of handling such a large volume of messages. It does not also guarantee that the data will be transmitted in the same order they were received.
  - **AWS Data Pipeline** : is incorrect because this is primarily used as a **cloud-based data workflow service** that helps you process and move data between different AWS services and **on-premises data sources**. It is not suitable for collecting data from distributed sources such as users, IoT devices, or clickstreams.

- You have just launched a new **API Gateway** service which uses AWS Lambda as a serverless computing service. In what **type of protocol will your API endpoint** be exposed?
  - **A) HTTPS**
  - Amazon API Gateway를 통해 생성된 모든 API는 HTTPS 엔드포인트만 제공합니다. Amazon API Gateway는 암호화되지 않은(HTTP) 엔드포인트를 지원하지 않습니다. 기본적으로 Amazon API Gateway는 Amazon API Gateway 인증서를 자동으로 사용하는 API에 내부 도메인을 할당합니다. API가 커스텀 도메인 이름에서 실행되도록 구성할 때, 도메인에 대한 자체 인증서를 제공할 수 있습니다.

- You are working for a multinational telecommunications company. Your IT Manager is willing to consolidate their log streams including the access, application, and security logs in one single system. Once consolidated, the company wants to **analyze these logs in real-time** based on heuristics. There will be some time in the future where the company will need to validate heuristics, which requires going back to data samples extracted from the last 12 hours.     
What is the best approach to meet this requirement?
  - **A) First, send all of the log events to Amazon Kinesis then afterwards, develop a client process to apply heuristics on the logs.**
