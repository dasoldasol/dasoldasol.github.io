## Scenario
- An automotive company is working on an autonomous vehicle development and deployment project using AWS. The solution requires High Performance Computing (HPC) in order to collect, store and manage massive amounts of data as well as to support deep learning frameworks. The Linux EC2 instances that will be used should have a lower latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based HPC systems. It should also enhance the performance of inter-instance communication and must include an OS-bypass functionality to allow the HPC to communicate directly with the network interface hardware to provide low-latency, reliable transport functionality.    
Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution that you should implement to achieve the above requirements?
